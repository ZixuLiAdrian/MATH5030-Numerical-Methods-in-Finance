# Efficient Numerical Methods for Pricing Arithmetic Asian Options

*MATH 5030 — Numerical Methods — Final Project Report*

This repository studies the pricing of **discretely monitored arithmetic
Asian call options** under the Black–Scholes / GBM model and compares several
published numerical methods on accuracy, computational efficiency, and
robustness.

The arithmetic average of lognormal prices does not admit a closed-form
distribution, so the exact price must be obtained numerically. We implement
**two analytic benchmarks** (Kemna–Vorst closed form, Levy approximation) and
**six MC/QMC estimators**, tested in seven configurations (Sobol is benchmarked
under both incremental and Brownian-bridge path construction). We measure how
tightly each configuration prices the option per unit of CPU time and show that
two classical variance-reduction ideas — **geometric-Asian control variate** and
**Brownian-bridge Sobol QMC** — improve root-mean-square error by **one to two
orders of magnitude** over plain Monte Carlo.

## 1. Results at a glance

Reference parameter set: `S0 = 100`, `K = 100`, `r = 5%`, `sigma = 30%`,
`T = 1 year`, `N = 50` monitoring dates. Reference price obtained from
randomised-QMC (2M Brownian-bridge paths, 32 scrambles) combined with a
second 1M-path antithetic+control-variate run; reference standard error is
below **2 × 10⁻⁴**.

| Method | RMSE @ 524k paths | Runtime | Gain over plain MC |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Standard Monte Carlo | 1.9 × 10⁻² | 0.18 s | 1.0 × |
| Antithetic variates | 8.2 × 10⁻³ | 0.16 s | ≈ 2.6 × |
| Sobol QMC — incremental | 1.8 × 10⁻³ | 0.46 s | ≈ 10 × |
| Control variate (geometric Asian) | 7.3 × 10⁻⁴ | 0.24 s | ≈ 26 × |
| Antithetic + Control variate | 7.8 × 10⁻⁴ | 0.19 s | ≈ 24 × |
| Randomised QMC — Brownian bridge | 3.5 × 10⁻⁴ | 0.43 s | ≈ 54 × |
| **Sobol QMC — Brownian bridge** | **2.3 × 10⁻⁴** | 0.43 s | **≈ 82 ×** |

*RMSE is measured across 12 independent replications with disjoint seeds;
see `experiments/run_efficiency.py`.*

![Efficiency: RMSE vs paths (left) and vs CPU time (right)](results/figures/efficiency_rmse_vs_time.png)

**Two classical methods dominate the efficiency curve:**

1. **Geometric-Asian control variate** leverages the closed-form price of
   the geometric Asian (Kemna–Vorst 1990) to subtract the dominant
   component of the arithmetic payoff's variance. On this problem it
   yields roughly a **25× variance reduction** with essentially no
   additional CPU cost.
2. **Brownian-bridge Sobol QMC** reorganises the random draws so that the
   first (best-equidistributed) Sobol coordinates control the coarse shape
   of the path (Glasserman 2004 §4.3). Combined with scrambling, it
   delivers an **~80× RMSE reduction** versus plain MC on this arithmetic
   Asian payoff.

## 2. Mathematical setup

Under the risk-neutral measure the underlying follows geometric Brownian
motion

$$ \frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t, \qquad S_0 \text{ given}. $$

For equally-spaced monitoring dates $t_i = i\,\Delta t,\; i = 1, \dots, N,\;\Delta t = T/N$
the **arithmetic average** and **arithmetic Asian call payoff** are

$$ A_N \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N S(t_i), \qquad \text{payoff} \;=\; \bigl(A_N - K\bigr)^+. $$

The arbitrage-free price is $C = e^{-rT}\,\mathbb{E}\bigl[(A_N - K)^+\bigr]$.
Because $A_N$ is a sum of correlated lognormals, $C$ has no elementary
closed form.

The auxiliary **geometric average**
$G_N = \bigl(\prod_i S(t_i)\bigr)^{1/N}$
is lognormal and therefore *does* admit a closed form (Kemna–Vorst 1990).
We use that price both as a benchmark in its own right and as the control
mean for variance reduction.

---

## 3. Methods implemented

The two analytic methods return a scalar price directly. The six MC/QMC
estimators take a common `AsianOptionParams` object and an `n_paths` budget,
and return `{price, std_err, runtime_s, n_paths, ...}`.

| Module | Function | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `analytic.py` | `geometric_asian_call_price` | Exact discrete Kemna–Vorst formula. |
| `analytic.py` | `levy_approx_call_price` | Levy (1992) lognormal moment-matching approximation. |
| `monte_carlo.py` | `standard_mc_price` | Plain MC. |
| `monte_carlo.py` | `antithetic_mc_price` | Antithetic variates. |
| `control_variate.py` | `control_variate_price` | Geometric-Asian control variate with sample-estimated `beta`. |
| `control_variate.py` | `antithetic_cv_price` | Antithetic + control variate combined. |
| `qmc.py` | `sobol_qmc_price` | Scrambled Sobol QMC, single replication. |
| `qmc.py` | `rqmc_sobol_price` | Randomised QMC, multiple scrambles, honest cross-replication SE. |
| `paths.py` | `build_paths` | Incremental **or** Brownian-bridge path construction. |

### Why Brownian bridge matters for QMC

The Sobol sequence is only *partially* equidistributed — its earliest
coordinates are much better-balanced than its last. The incremental
construction assigns equal variance to every coordinate, so the last
monitoring dates are simulated from the Sobol sequence's worst coordinates.
The Brownian-bridge construction places the terminal value on the first
coordinate and then fills in midpoints by bisection, concentrating the
integrand's variance on the best Sobol coordinates.

We implement it as a one-time $N \times N$ matrix multiplication:
`W = z @ B.T`, where the bridge matrix $B$ is built once and cached
(`brownian_bridge_matrix` in `paths.py`). The unit test
`test_brownian_bridge_matrix_reproduces_covariance` verifies
$B B^\top = \bigl(\min(t_i, t_j)\bigr)_{i,j}$ exactly.

### Fixing the discrete Kemna–Vorst formula

The scaffold shipped with an incorrect $\sigma_g$ for *discretely*
monitored geometric Asians. A 2M-path antithetic Monte Carlo disagreed with
the closed form by **19 standard errors** at `sigma = 0.2`. The correct
moments for equally-spaced monitoring are

$$ \sigma_g^2\,T \;=\; \sigma^2 T\,\frac{(N+1)(2N+1)}{6 N^2}, \qquad b_g \;=\; (r - \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^2)\,\frac{N+1}{2N} \;+\; \tfrac{1}{2}\sigma_g^2. $$

After the fix, the closed form agrees with antithetic Monte Carlo to within
`0.9 × SE` across a 12-scenario validation grid (see §4).

---

## 4. Validation

The validation pipeline lives in `experiments/run_validation.py` and writes
two tables to `results/tables/`.

### 4.1 Geometric Asian: closed form vs. Monte Carlo

`geometric_validation.csv`: Kemna–Vorst closed form versus an antithetic MC
estimator at 200k pairs. The maximum $|z|$-score across a 12-scenario
`(sigma, K)` grid is **0.86** — i.e. every closed-form price is within one
standard error of its MC estimate.

| sigma | K | closed form | MC price | |z|-score |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.10 |  90 | 11.9127 | 11.9136 | 0.74 |
| 0.10 | 100 |  3.6355 |  3.6400 | 0.85 |
| 0.20 | 100 |  5.6411 |  5.6516 | 0.86 |
| 0.30 | 100 |  7.6225 |  7.6394 | 0.86 |
| 0.50 | 100 | 11.3296 | 11.3590 | 0.82 |

### 4.2 Arithmetic Asian: method error vs. a high-precision reference

`arithmetic_validation.csv`: for the same grid we compute a high-precision
reference (RQMC bridge + antithetic-CV, ~2M paths each, reference SE ≤
3 × 10⁻⁴), then report each method's error at a fixed 100k-path budget.

Representative errors at `S0 = 100`, `K = 100`, `T = 1`, `N = 50`:

| Method | sigma = 0.10 | sigma = 0.20 | sigma = 0.30 | sigma = 0.50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Levy approximation | +0.0059 | +0.0192 | +0.0460 | +0.1664 |
| Standard MC | +0.0046 | +0.0114 | +0.0200 | +0.0401 |
| Antithetic | +0.0048 | +0.0099 | +0.0161 | +0.0311 |
| Control variate | +0.0001 | +0.0002 | +0.0001 | +0.0006 |
| Antithetic + CV | −0.0002 | −0.0008 | −0.0015 | −0.0035 |
| Sobol (bridge) | −0.0001 | −0.0000 | +0.0002 | +0.0010 |
| RQMC (bridge) | +0.0002 | +0.0005 | +0.0008 | +0.0014 |

**Key observations.** (1) The Levy approximation is excellent up to `sigma ≈
0.3` (<~50 bps), but deteriorates rapidly beyond that (>200 bps at
`sigma = 0.5`) — consistent with Levy's own published tables. (2) CV, A+CV,
Sobol-bridge and RQMC-bridge are all within a handful of basis points of
the reference across every scenario, regardless of moneyness or volatility.

### 4.3 Continuous-limit cross-validation (PyFENG BsmAsianJsu)

As $N \to \infty$ the discrete monitoring grid becomes dense and the discrete
Asian price must converge to the continuous arithmetic Asian price. We
cross-validate against PyFENG's `BsmAsianJsu` (Johnson's SU approximation,
Choi & Kwok 2022) as an independent continuous benchmark:

| N | Our discrete price | PyFENG JSU | Gap |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|   52 | 5.8541 | 5.7630 | +0.0912 |
|  250 | 5.7824 | 5.7630 | +0.0194 |
|  500 | 5.7719 | 5.7630 | +0.0090 |
| 1000 | 5.7679 | 5.7630 | +0.0049 |

*`S0 = K = 100`, `r = 5%`, `sigma = 20%`, `T = 1 year`. Discrete prices from
RQMC bridge (131k paths, 16 scrambles). Gap shrinks monotonically at the
expected $O(1/N)$ rate, confirming internal consistency between the discrete
and continuous formulations.*

Run `python experiments/run_validation.py` to reproduce
`results/tables/pyfeng_convergence.csv`. PyFENG can be installed with
`pip install pyfeng`.

## 5. Robustness

`experiments/run_robustness.py` produces three tables.

### 5.1 Random parameter sweep (`robustness_random.csv`)

200 scenarios with `sigma ∈ [0.05, 0.80]`, `T ∈ [0.25, 3.0]`, moneyness
`K/S0 ∈ [0.7, 1.3]`, `r ∈ [0.0, 0.10]`, `N ∈ {12, 26, 52, 100, 250}`:

| Method | NaNs | Out-of-bounds | Mean SE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Standard MC | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.142 |
| Antithetic | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.113 |
| Control variate | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.017 |
| Antithetic + CV | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.017 |
| Sobol bridge | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.142 *(proxy SE)* |
| RQMC bridge | 0 | ≤ 1 | **0.007** |

Zero NaNs, zero crashes. The rare out-of-bounds count (≤ 1 per method across
200 scenarios) reflects Monte Carlo noise on a tight geometric-Asian lower
bound — not a pricing error. The RQMC bridge SE is honest (cross-scramble);
the single-run Sobol "SE" is the classical MC formula applied to QMC samples,
which is why it looks similar to plain MC despite a much tighter empirical RMSE.

### 5.2 Monotonicity (`robustness_monotonicity.csv`)

Strike grid $K \in [70, 130]$ (31 points) and volatility grid
$\sigma \in [0.05, 0.80]$ (31 points). For every method checked (CV, A+CV,
RQMC) the call price is **weakly decreasing in K** and **weakly increasing
in σ** — no violations — which matches arbitrage-free theory.

### 5.3 Edge cases (`robustness_edge_cases.csv`)

* `sigma → 0`: all Monte Carlo / QMC estimators converge to the
  deterministic intrinsic value (2.46511). The geometric closed-form
  correctly converges to a *different* deterministic value (2.45495),
  reflecting Jensen's inequality between the arithmetic and geometric
  averages.
* Deep OTM (`K ∈ {200, 400}`): every estimator returns exactly `0.0`.
* Dense monitoring (`N = 500`): variance-reduced estimators (CV, A+CV,
  Sobol bridge, RQMC) agree with each other to within 2 bp. Plain MC and
  antithetic are noisier at the same path budget, as expected.

---

## 6. Efficiency study

`experiments/run_efficiency.py` sweeps the path budget across five orders
of magnitude (2k → 524k) and reports RMSE vs. paths *and* RMSE vs. CPU
time. Each grid point is averaged over 12 independent repetitions with
disjoint seeds. Full results in `results/tables/efficiency.csv`; the
figure `results/figures/efficiency_rmse_vs_time.png` is reproduced in §1.

Key take-aways:

* **All Monte Carlo methods show the expected $n^{-1/2}$ convergence**; the
  control-variate and antithetic+CV curves sit a full order of magnitude
  below plain MC in parallel.
* **Sobol bridge achieves super-$n^{-1/2}$ convergence**: going from 2k to
  524k paths (256× more work) reduces RMSE by a factor of ≈ 37 — faster
  than the $\sqrt{256} = 16$ a plain MC would deliver.
* **Incremental Sobol is only ~3× better than plain MC**; the bridge
  construction is what unlocks QMC's variance advantage on this payoff.

## 9. Test coverage

`pytest` reports **47 passing tests** covering:

* **Analytic prices** — closed-form geometric Asian matches antithetic MC
  to < 3 SE; reduces to Black–Scholes at `N = 1`; correct zero-volatility
  limit; Levy approximation matches MC to < 1% at `sigma = 0.2`.
* **Path construction** — Brownian-bridge matrix reproduces the
  Brownian-motion covariance exactly for arbitrary `N`; terminal value sits
  on the first Sobol coordinate; both constructions match theoretical mean
  and variance empirically.
* **Estimators** — every estimator has the expected return keys, is
  deterministic given a seed, rejects invalid budgets, produces the
  expected variance-reduction ordering (antithetic < MC, CV < antithetic,
  RQMC ≤ CV), and deep-ITM / deep-OTM prices lie in the correct range.
* **Monotonicity** — every variance-reduced estimator is weakly decreasing
  in `K` and weakly increasing in `sigma` on dense grids.

## 11. Reproducibility

Every experiment uses a fixed seed (`SEED = 20240420` by default).
`numpy.random.default_rng` plus `scipy.stats.qmc.Sobol(..., seed=...)` are
deterministic given those seeds, so all tables and the efficiency figure
reproduce bit-for-bit on re-run. The full `run_validation` + `run_robustness`
+ `run_efficiency` pipeline completes in **under two minutes** on a 2020
MacBook Pro (M1, single-threaded NumPy).
