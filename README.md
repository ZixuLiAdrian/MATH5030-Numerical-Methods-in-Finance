Pricing an arithmetic Asian option requires simulation because the average of lognormal prices has no closed-form distribution. This package implements two analytic benchmarks and six Monte Carlo / Quasi-Monte Carlo estimators, and shows that combining a **geometric-Asian control variate** with **Brownian-bridge Sobol QMC** reduces pricing error by up to **82×** versus plain Monte Carlo at the same computational cost.

## Innovations

While the core methods are classical, several aspects of this project go beyond textbook reproduction:

- **Continuous-limit cross-validation** — we independently verify that our discrete prices converge to the continuous arithmetic Asian price at the expected $O(1/N)$ rate, using PyFENG's `BsmAsianJsu` as an external benchmark. This is not a standard validation step.
- **Empirical variance reduction measurement** — the control variate estimators report a `var_reduction` key computed from the sample, making the speedup measurable rather than just claimed.
- **Combined antithetic + CV estimator** — `antithetic_cv_price` stacks antithetic sampling and the geometric control variate together, which standard references treat separately.
- **RMSE vs. CPU time efficiency study** — we measure root-mean-square error across 12 independent replications at five path budgets and plot against both paths and wall-clock time, giving a fairer comparison than RMSE vs. paths alone.

params = AsianOptionParams(S0=100, K=100, r=0.05, sigma=0.30, T=1.0, N=50)

# Antithetic + control variate (~25x variance reduction)
print(antithetic_cv_price(params, n_paths=100_000))
# {'price': 8.0726, 'std_err': 0.0005, 'runtime_s': 0.04, 'n_paths': 100000, 'beta': 1.03, 'var_reduction': 586.0}

print(rqmc_sobol_price(params, n_paths=131_072, n_replications=16, path_method="brownian_bridge"))
# {'price': 8.0727, 'std_err': 0.0002, 'runtime_s': 0.12, 'n_paths': 131072, ...}

## API reference

### `AsianOptionParams`

Frozen dataclass holding all option parameters. Validated automatically by every pricing function.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `S0` | `float` | Initial stock price |
| `K` | `float` | Strike price (> 0) |
| `r` | `float` | Risk-free rate |
| `sigma` | `float` | Volatility (> 0) |
| `T` | `float` | Time to maturity in years (> 0) |
| `N` | `int` | Number of monitoring dates (≥ 1) |
| `option_type` | `str` | `"call"` (default) or `"put"` |

### Analytic benchmarks

| Function | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `geometric_asian_call_price(params)` | `float` | Exact Kemna–Vorst (1990) closed form for the discrete geometric Asian call. |
| `levy_approx_call_price(params)` | `float` | Levy (1992) lognormal moment-matching approximation. Accurate for `sigma ≲ 0.3`. |

### MC / QMC estimators

All estimators return a `dict` with at minimum `{price, std_err, runtime_s, n_paths}`.

| Function | Extra keys | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standard_mc_price(params, n_paths, seed, path_method)` | — | Plain Monte Carlo. |
| `antithetic_mc_price(params, n_paths, seed, path_method)` | — | Antithetic variates; pairs each draw `z` with `−z`. |
| `control_variate_price(params, n_paths, seed, path_method)` | `beta`, `var_reduction` | Geometric-Asian control variate with sample-estimated `beta`. |
| `antithetic_cv_price(params, n_paths, seed, path_method)` | `beta`, `var_reduction` | Antithetic + control variate combined. |
| `sobol_qmc_price(params, n_paths, seed, path_method)` | — | Single scrambled Sobol replication. `std_err` is a proxy only. |
| `rqmc_sobol_price(params, n_paths, seed, n_replications, path_method)` | `n_replications` | Multiple scrambles; reports an honest cross-replication SE. |

**`path_method`** — `"incremental"` (default) or `"brownian_bridge"`. The bridge construction concentrates path variance on the best-equidistributed Sobol coordinates and is recommended for QMC estimators.

## Mathematical setup

Under the risk-neutral measure the underlying follows geometric Brownian motion

$$ \frac{dS_t}{S_t} = r\,dt + \sigma\,dW_t, \qquad S_0 \text{ given}. $$

For equally-spaced monitoring dates $t_i = i\,\Delta t,\; i = 1, \dots, N,\;\Delta t = T/N$ the **arithmetic average** and **Asian call payoff** are

$$ A_N \;=\; \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N S(t_i), \qquad \text{payoff} \;=\; \bigl(A_N - K\bigr)^+. $$

The arbitrage-free price is $C = e^{-rT}\,\mathbb{E}\bigl[(A_N - K)^+\bigr]$. Because $A_N$ is a sum of correlated lognormals, $C$ has no elementary closed form.

The auxiliary **geometric average** $G_N = \bigl(\prod_i S(t_i)\bigr)^{1/N}$ is lognormal and admits a closed form (Kemna–Vorst 1990). We use that price as a benchmark and as the control mean for variance reduction.

## Validation

### Geometric Asian: closed form vs. Monte Carlo

Kemna–Vorst closed form versus antithetic MC at 200k pairs. Maximum $|z|$-score across a 12-scenario `(sigma, K)` grid is **0.86** — every closed-form price within one standard error of its MC estimate.

| sigma | K | closed form | MC price | \|z\|-score |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0.10 |  90 | 11.9127 | 11.9136 | 0.74 |
| 0.10 | 100 |  3.6355 |  3.6400 | 0.85 |
| 0.20 | 100 |  5.6411 |  5.6516 | 0.86 |
| 0.30 | 100 |  7.6225 |  7.6394 | 0.86 |
| 0.50 | 100 | 11.3296 | 11.3590 | 0.82 |

### Arithmetic Asian: method error vs. high-precision reference

Errors at `S0 = 100`, `K = 100`, `T = 1`, `N = 50` (reference SE ≤ 3 × 10⁻⁴):

| Method | sigma = 0.10 | sigma = 0.20 | sigma = 0.30 | sigma = 0.50 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Levy approximation | +0.0059 | +0.0192 | +0.0460 | +0.1664 |
| Standard MC | +0.0046 | +0.0114 | +0.0200 | +0.0401 |
| Antithetic | +0.0048 | +0.0099 | +0.0161 | +0.0311 |
| Control variate | +0.0001 | +0.0002 | +0.0001 | +0.0006 |
| Antithetic + CV | −0.0002 | −0.0008 | −0.0015 | −0.0035 |
| Sobol (bridge) | −0.0001 | −0.0000 | +0.0002 | +0.0010 |
| RQMC (bridge) | +0.0002 | +0.0005 | +0.0008 | +0.0014 |

### Continuous-limit cross-validation (PyFENG BsmAsianJsu)

As $N \to \infty$ discrete prices converge to the continuous arithmetic Asian price. Cross-validated against PyFENG's `BsmAsianJsu` (Johnson's SU approximation):

| N | Our discrete price | PyFENG JSU | Gap |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
|   52 | 5.8541 | 5.7630 | +0.0912 |
|  250 | 5.7824 | 5.7630 | +0.0194 |
|  500 | 5.7719 | 5.7630 | +0.0090 |
| 1000 | 5.7679 | 5.7630 | +0.0049 |

*Gap shrinks at the expected $O(1/N)$ rate.*

## Robustness

### Random parameter sweep

200 scenarios across `sigma ∈ [0.05, 0.80]`, `T ∈ [0.25, 3.0]`, moneyness `K/S0 ∈ [0.7, 1.3]`, `r ∈ [0.0, 0.10]`, `N ∈ {12, 26, 52, 100, 250}`:

| Method | NaNs | Out-of-bounds | Mean SE |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Standard MC | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.142 |
| Antithetic | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.113 |
| Control variate | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.017 |
| Antithetic + CV | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.017 |
| Sobol bridge | 0 | ≤ 1 | 0.142 *(proxy SE)* |
| RQMC bridge | 0 | ≤ 1 | **0.007** |

Zero NaNs, zero crashes. The rare out-of-bounds count (≤ 1 per method) reflects Monte Carlo noise on a tight geometric-Asian lower bound — not a pricing error.

### Monotonicity

Strike grid $K \in [70, 130]$ and volatility grid $\sigma \in [0.05, 0.80]$ (31 points each). Every variance-reduced method is **weakly decreasing in K** and **weakly increasing in σ** — no violations.

### Edge cases

- `sigma → 0`: all MC/QMC estimators converge to the deterministic intrinsic value (2.46511). The geometric closed-form correctly gives a different value (2.45495) by Jensen's inequality.
- Deep OTM (`K ∈ {200, 400}`): every estimator returns exactly `0.0`.
- Dense monitoring (`N = 500`): variance-reduced estimators (CV, A+CV, Sobol bridge, RQMC) agree within 2 bp of each other.
